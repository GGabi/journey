# Journey

An ergonomic keyboard layout inspired by Recurva and Wedlock.

```
w b d l k  j r u o y
c s t h v  q n e a i
p f g m z  / x ' , .
```

Low SfBs (0.7 w/ punct), high inward-rolls, low LsBs and first-class accommodation for all the *H bigrams (which are the most common in English by far). Redirects are average and almost all are on the Index finger (ideal).

More could you want?

## Variants

### Journey BQ

Sacrifice some SfB% to reduce Right Ring and Pinky finger usage without gaining the YUO redirect.

```
w y d l k  j r o u q
c s t h v  b n e a i
p f g m z  / x ' , .
```

### Journey OU

If you can live with the YUO redirect the feel free to use this variant, which has more sensible right finger usage.

```
w b d l k  j r o u y
c s t h v  q n e a i
p f g m z  / x ' , .
